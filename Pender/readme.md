In order to run this now, make sure you have
  NodeJS installed.

Once you have NodeJS, you need Bower.
  npm install -g Bower

Once both are installed, go to the folder where this file is (in command prompt)
Type in:
  npm install
let it finihs
then type in
  bower install

once that is donw, still in command prompt, type
  grunt

Now, it should host your site locally, and open the browser to your homepage.
Any changes you make to any files will automatically be processed, and the browser reloaded instantly.

Your JS is now in src/js/lin.js
Your CSS is now in src/css/style.css

These are the only ones you need to change, dont worry about the ones in dist
